In this project we implemented very naive simple prototype of a secure payment system,
which relies on a single trusted authority - the Bank.

A few notes:
* We implemented the transactions hash in a block using a merkle-tree.
* Each wallet has a list of coins that are associated with him, as well as a list of
  unspent-coins, meaning it didn't already spend them (using transaction that maybe
  did not enter the blockchain yet).
  The wallet can try to spend the same coind multiple times by calling the function unfreeze_all
  which initialize the unspent_coins list back to the whole coins list of the wallet.
